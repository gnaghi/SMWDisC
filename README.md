Super Mario World disassembly

> All.log++ is the combined efforts of the Super Mario World Disassembly and Commentary project, which is now in a unknown state since etherpad is going down. Compiled here is the source code of Super Mario World, made by MikeyK, but with a large amount of routines clarified with labels, comments, and code explanations.

This is an unofficial continuation by Revenant and BMF54123 of the original disassembly project. The goal is to both complete and comment as much of the disassembly as possible, and to also convert it to source files which can actually be modified and re-assembled.
